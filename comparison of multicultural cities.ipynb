There are more than 800 languages are spoken in New York City. It's one of the most multicultural cities in the world.\nToronto is Canada's largest city, the fourth largest in North American, and home to a diverse population. The diverse population of Toronto reflects its role as an important destination for immigrants to Canada. Over 160 languages are spoken in the city. Toronto is also one of the most multicultural cities in the world.\nLos Angeles is one of the most stylish cities in the world. Almost 100 language speaking people reside at Los Angeles and hence every style, dress and cuisines of this city is different. Los Angeles is a welcoming place for immigrants.It is also one of the most multicultural cities in the world.\n\nNew York, Toronto and Los Angeles are all multicultural cities. They attract thousands of people from all over the world to live in. While the cities have some similarities and may be attractive to various people depending on lifestyles and preferences. In this project we will try to compare these three multicultural cities to see how similar they are. There are so many ways to compare cities. In this project we would like to use foursquare data to compare venues (i.e. density, distribution, categories of venues) in these cities and their clustered neighbourhoods. We will use our data science powers to determine if the cities are similar or dissimilar in multiple ways. ",

We can find Toronto's neibourhoods and the latitude and logitude coordinates of each neighborhood from wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M. A csv file contians latitude and logitude information of Toronto.
